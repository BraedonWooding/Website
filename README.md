## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
|:----------------  |:-------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |

> NOTE: Due to an issue with unocss integration into astro you'll have to run `npm run unocss` to generate the unocss file for production, for dev it just has to exist but won't use it.
